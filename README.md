# Verkle Tree Optimization ETH

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum network by implementing Verkle Trees for state storage and retrieval. By transitioning to a stateless client architecture, we can significantly reduce storage requirements and improve transaction validation times.

## Problem Statement
The current state storage in Ethereum is becoming increasingly large and difficult to manage, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs. This project addresses these challenges by introducing Verkle Trees, which offer more efficient state storage and retrieval.

## Proposed Solution
Our solution involves:
- **Verkle Tree Data Structure:** Developing a Verkle Tree for efficient state storage and retrieval.
- **Witness Generation:** Creating a system for generating and validating transaction witnesses without the need for the full state.
- **Stateless Client Prototype:** Building a prototype Ethereum client that operates without storing the entire state.
- **Integration and Testing:** Testing the prototype on a testnet, analyzing performance, and optimizing the system.

## MVP Features
- **Verkle Tree Data Structure:** Efficient state storage and retrieval.
- **Witness Generation:** Transaction witness generation and validation without the full state.
- **Stateless Client Prototype:** A working Ethereum client prototype without the full state trie.
- **Testnet Deployment:** Demonstration of functionality on a testnet with relevant test cases.

## Expected Outcome
- **Prototype and Testing:** A stateless Ethereum client prototype optimized with Verkle Trees, ready for further testing by the Ethereum Foundation.
- **Comprehensive Report:** Detailed documentation of the development process, testing methodologies, and performance metrics.
- **Integration Recommendations:** Suggested paths for mainnet integration.
